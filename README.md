To run BookShop project it's necessary to start both mock and front server:

- cd api
- yarn install
- yarn start

- cd front
- yarn install
- yarn start

TODO's for feature release :)

- transition on pagination change
- more cart-management tools
- persisting cart state (cookies or session storage usage)

//FIXME: bug on post request - err 422
